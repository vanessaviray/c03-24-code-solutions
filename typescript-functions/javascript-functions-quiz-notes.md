## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  they are the basic building blocks of any application in JavaScript. They take input arguments and return output values
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword, optional name, a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by parenthesis, the start of a functions code block (opening curly brace), an optional return statement, and the ending curly brace to identify the end of the code block
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the name of the function followed by parenthesis containing argument(s)
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  the function contains the keyword function followed by a code block with some lines of code and a possible return statement, while the call only consists of the name of the function and the arguments
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameter is a placeholder whose value is unknown until we call the function and pass an argument.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  it allows the function the flexibility of inputting different arguments, instead of having to rewrite the function more than once.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program and it prevents anymore code in the function's code block from being run.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  the parameters, followed by the equals and greater than sign, followed by either some code, a code block, or a return statement
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  you would not need to specify the return keyword
