## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint in a responsive design is the “point” at which a website's content and design will adapt in a certain way
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
It allows the page to adapt to the device that is being used to render it
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
because the media queries are all on the same level of specificity so the last css rule set will be selected.
