## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the Event Queue model of Promises?

  - When the Promise is created, the Promise task is synchronously put onto the Event Queue.
  - Synchronous execution of the calling code continues until the end of the function(s).
  - When the current functions complete, the Event Loop runs.
  - The Promise task is taken from the Event Queue and executed.
  - After the Promise task completes:
    - If it completes successfully, the Promise calls the then handler
    - If it completes with an error, the Promise calls the catch handler
    - The Promise then calls the finally handler (in all cases).

  pending, fulfilled, rejected

  then method
