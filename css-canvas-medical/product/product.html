                    Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
                    clinicians, staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making
                    you more productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit
                    more joy into your practice of medicine.

              Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you
              never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
              interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

              &quot;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance
              dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to
              use. The right information is presented in the right way at the
              right time, and the product leverages technology to actually
              improve the quality of care I provide.&quot;

            <h3>It automates performance improvement</h3>
            <p>
              Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
              performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and
              increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols
              and charge capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work
              only they can do.

              &quot;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as
              complex as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to
              keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality
              team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in
              Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and
              revenue performance.&quot;
