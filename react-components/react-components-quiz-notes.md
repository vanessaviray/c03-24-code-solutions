## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a React component?
  A React component is a reusable piece of code that defines a part of a user interface (UI) in a React application.

- How do you define a component in React?
  It is similar to defining a javascript function. The function name starts with a capital letter, has an optional export and returns jsx.

  You would call the components in the function, wrapped in the <></> tags. This fragment will return the components inside and push it to the DOM for the browser to render.
