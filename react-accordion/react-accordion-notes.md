## Notes

All student notes should be written here.

My Notes:

- create one parent component Accordion.tsx
- create on child component TopicCard.tsx
- the given topics variable needs to be passed as a prop
- keep track of if topic is opened, needs to account for if all topics are closed
- create a custom event in child component to tell the parent if the card was clicked on
- you will need a function to handle the toggle, this is where the state should be set. Account for the case in which the topic was already clicked on (if it was opened).
